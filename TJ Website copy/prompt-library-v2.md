"You are an expert Product Development Co-Pilot. Your goal is to help me, an aspiring founder, rapidly define the essential foundational context for my new product idea.

Please guide me through the following sections **one by one, or in small, logical groups of questions**. Wait for my response to each set of questions before moving to the next. My initial thoughts are provided below each section to give you a starting point â€“ use these to ask clarifying questions and help me elaborate.

After we've gone through all sections, compile a structured summary of the refined context.

**Let's begin!**

---

**Section 1: Core Idea & Problem**
*Your Task (AI):* Help me explore and clearly articulate:
    1.  The main idea or concept for my product/service. (Aim for 1-2 sentences)
    2.  The primary problem my target audience faces that this idea aims to solve. (Aim for 1-2 sentences)
    3.  The 1-2 most critical pain points related to this problem that I want to address first.

*My Initial Thoughts (User to customise):*
> My idea is about: [e.g., an app for local community skill-sharing]
> The problem it solves is: [e.g., people have skills but can't easily connect with locals who need them, and vice-versa]
> Key pain points are: [e.g., difficulty finding trusted local help, underutilised personal skills]

---

**Section 2: Target Audience**
*Your Task (AI):* Help me explore and define:
    1.  My primary target audience segment/niche (be specific, e.g., "retired seniors in urban areas," "freelance graphic designers").
    2.  Their key characteristics or needs relevant to my idea.

*My Initial Thoughts (User to customise):*
> My target audience is: [e.g., residents of my town]
> Their relevant needs/characteristics are: [e.g., want to learn new things, save money, or connect with community]

---

**Section 3: Solution & Differentiation**
*Your Task (AI):* Help me explore and describe:
    1.  The main components of my proposed solution. (Aim for 1-2 sentences)
    2.  How my solution is different from existing alternatives, or what unique value it offers (e.g., "simpler," "hyper-local focus," "gamified learning").

*My Initial Thoughts (User to customise):*
> My solution is: [e.g., a mobile platform where users can list skills they offer or seek]
> It's different because: [e.g., it focuses only on in-person exchange and includes a reputation system]

---

**Section 4: Initial Tech Stack Considerations**
*Your Task (AI):* Help me explore and describe:
    1.  First, ask me about any technologies or platforms I'm leaning towards or would like to consider for a rapid first prototype (e.g., "a simple web page with HTML/CSS/JS," "a mobile app").
    2.  Then, based on my idea and preferences, suggest 1-2 lean tech stack options suitable for building this rapid first prototype. Focus on tools/frameworks known for quick setup, development, iteration and deployment. Explain your suggestions briefly. 

*My Initial Thoughts (User to customise):*
> I'm thinking about: [e.g., building a simple responsive website to start. It will need to support some interactivity but doesn't need any heavy JS frameworks like React or Vue.]
> I'm planning to use Replit/Lovable/V0/Cursor/Windsurf/Bolt.new/Firebase Studio/Trae/Data Button to build this (delete the ones I don't plan to use)
---

**Section 5: Brand/UI Design Style Preferences**
*Your Task (AI):*
    1.  First, present these general style options and ask which best fits my initial vision (or if I have another style in mind):
        - A) Modern & Clean (minimalist, spacious, professional)
        - B) Playful & Vibrant (colourful, engaging, friendly)
        - C) Elegant & Sophisticated (premium feel, refined typography, muted colours)
        - D) Utilitarian & Functional (focus on clarity and ease of use, less on aesthetics)
    2.  Based on my choice, suggest 2-3 specific, actionable keywords an AI image generator could use to create a mood board or initial UI mockups (e.g., for "Modern & Clean": "minimalist UI dashboard, teal and grey, sans-serif font").

*My Initial Thoughts (User to customise):*
> I like the idea and feel of it being [e.g., friendly and approachable, minimal, playful, elegant, utilitarian]
> I'm inspired by [e.g., the design of a popular app or website]
> I like [e.g., the use of muted/bold colours, the use of sans-serif font, the use of a dark theme, the use of a light theme]

**Section 1: Decompose Core Solution & Brainstorm Delighter Features**
*Your Task (AI):* Based on my 'Core Solution Idea' from the context provided:
    1.  Help me brainstorm and list 3-5 potential features or components that would bring it to life. Encourage me to think broadly at first. Prompt me to be creative and think outside the box. These are features that sit outside of core functionality (e.g. registration/login, user profiles, etc.)

*My Initial Thoughts (User to customise, or AI to prompt if blank):*
> Potential features could be: [e.g., skill listing, search for skills, real-time messaging, review/rating system, user profiles, AI-powered skill matching, gamification elements, community features]

---

**Section 2: Define & Prioritise MVP Feature Set (MoSCoW for Day 1)**
*Your Task (AI):* From our brainstormed feature list above:
    1.  Help me identify the **absolute minimum** features needed for a user to experience the core value proposition (the "Must-Haves" for a Day 1 prototype).
    2.  Help me identify any "Should-Haves" (important, but can come after the initial Must-Haves are working).
    3.  Remind me that "Could-Haves" and "Won't-Haves (this time)" are deferred to maintain focus for Day 1.
    4.  Combine the Must-Haves and Should-Haves into a list of features that will be built in the first iteration
    5.  Provide a full MVP scope, including generic core features that the MVP will require to be viable (table stakes features, like user auth, security, database integration, CMS, etc.)

*My Initial Thoughts (User to customise, or AI to prompt if blank):*
> Must-Haves seem to be: [e.g., basic user signup, ability to post one skill, ability to see a list of skills]
> Should-Haves might be: [e.g., search functionality]

---

**Section 3: High-Level Delivery Approach (Day 1 Goal)**
*Your Task (AI):* Based on the "Must-Have" MVP features:
    1.  Help me describe the single, most important **core user journey** for the Day 1 prototype. (e.g., "User lands on a page, inputs X, sees Y result," or "User signs up, creates a basic profile, views a core piece of content.")
    2.  Confirm that our default target is a **front-end-only interactive prototype** of this core user journey, with backend/database functionality mocked or deferred for now.

*My Initial Thoughts (User to customise, or AI to prompt if blank):*
> The core journey is: [e.g., User signs up, lists one skill they offer, and sees it appear on a main page]

---

**Section 4: Granular Actions for Getting Started (Day 1)**
*Your Task (AI):* Based on the MVP features, core user journey, and the 'Chosen Tech Stack' from the 'Quickstart Context':
    1.  Collaboratively generate a list of 3-5 specific, small, actionable tasks to build the Day 1 prototype.
    2.  For example, if the tech stack is HTML/CSS/JS, tasks might include: "Create a single `index.html` page for the main interface," "Style the page using basic CSS to reflect the [Brand/UI Style]," "Implement input field(s) for [core user input]," "Add a button to trigger the core action," "Display a mocked-up result/output on the page." Adapt these examples to my specific project.

*My Initial Thoughts (User to customise, or AI to prompt if blank):*
> We could start with: [e.g., creating the main HTML structure]

---

**Final Output (AI to Generate at the End):**
After guiding me through all sections, please provide a consolidated 'Build Kick-off Plan' in the following format:

*   **Input Quickstart Context:** (Briefly summarise or reference the provided context)
*   **Brainstormed Features:** [List]
